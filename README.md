# the-game-prototype

2 Flyers (Players) fly against each other, Player 1 enters the tunnel first, Player 2 immediatly follows. They then fly so called "Lines" in the windtunnel (moving up, down, doing tricks, ...) The follower always has to do the same as the leader.

On the outside of the tunnel there will be 3 judges – they will check if the follower does exactly as they should or if they make any mistakes – same for the leader.
If one of the judges sees an error they will press a button and that info has to be stored in the game state.

After 90 seconds the Leader/Follower switch

Then after they finish the round, the game state from both games is compared to see who won. (busts = negative point. the player with less busts wins.)
